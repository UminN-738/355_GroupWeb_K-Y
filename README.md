## Subject: Analyzing Starter Pokemon Preference Rankings for Each Generation.

In this project, I will explore how the popularity of starter Pokemon types (Grass, Fire, and Water) has evolved across each game generation. The aim is to identify trends in starter preferences and analyze factors such as design and stats. This analysis will provide insights into how different designs and marketing strategies have influenced Pokemon fan preferences over time.
The visualization will focus on the mainline Pokemon series from Generation I to the current generation, highlighting iconic starters like Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle, as well as more recent starters like Sprigatito, Fuecoco, and Quaxly. Additionally, the analysis will compare the popularity of Grass, Fire, and Water types within each generation.

## Goal: We want to find out patterns in how fans have responded to each generation’s starter Pokemon. Our aim is to discover which Pokemon players choose as their starter in each generation and make a case for how Pokemon’s design choices may influence fans’ preferences.
